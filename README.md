# Custom TabView

In this simple but effective application, I wanted to show how those who are bored with the classic tab bar design can create a custom Tabbar in SwiftUI. There are many different Tabbars that can be obtained, this is just one of them.

You can see what kind of Tabbar you will have after coding from the plugin.
